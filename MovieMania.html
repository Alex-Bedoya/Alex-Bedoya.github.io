									<h1>Movie Mania</h1>
									<p>
										This is an android application that allows users to save, rank, and add movies to lists. This was my final project for my Android class and wanted to take it a step 
										further and publish it to the Google Play Store. The added challenge to this project was to use something new, which I used Firebase for user accounts
										and a real-time database storage. I also used an API to get the movie data.

									<div class="image left"><img src="images/ManiaMaster.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<div class="image right"><img src="images/ManiaSearch.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								</ul>

								</ul>

									I made this app because I wanted to be able to sort the movies I watch or want to watch. With this application you can curate your own Master List,
									Want to Watch List, Owned List, and Ranked List. Inside the Want to Watch list, the user is able to click a button to randomly select a movie on that list.
									While inside the Ranked List, the user will be able to click and drag to reorder the list, or share that list. </br>
									The user is able to add a new movie to the Master List by clicking the "+" button and searching for that movie. </br>
									When a user clicks on a movie from the Master List, they will be taken to that movie's details, the details of the movie contain: 
									Title, release year, rating, runtime, average user score, director, composer, trailer link, overview, some actors, and genres.
									The movie details also contains things the user can edit, like which lists the movie is in, user notes or comments, and a user rating out of five stars. 
								</p>

								<p>
									One of the hardest parts of this project was using the rest API. The API I was using came from "The Movie Database" where I was able to get all the 
									movie details in a single call, but parsing through all the data became challenging as there were so many objects. </br>
									The first image above is how I got the rating for the movie. Since the API call gave me all the possible rating for each of the releases and countries,
									I had to parse through it to find the one I needed. I looped through them all, looking for all releases in the US that had an actual release date. I then find the 
									one with an actual "certification" and save that as the rating. </br>
									The second image shows how I get the Director and Composer for the movie. I had to loop through all the crew list and find the crew memebers who's "job" was listed as 
									a "Director" or a "Original Music Composer" and save their name. 
								</p>
								</br>

								<p>
									This code above shows how I got the Master List to show using a Firebase Database and recycler view. I first get the database reference that points
									to the Master List of the current user. I then add a database listener than will call whenever that data changes. When the data changes, it will
									clear the current movie list and load it with a new one. Once the data is loaded, then I sort it in alphabetical order and display it to the recycler view.
								</p></br>


								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ManiaRankedDragCode1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									This last snippet of code above shows how I got the click and drag to work with the Ranked List. I used a ItemTouchHelper which activates when the user
									clicks, holds, and drags an element on the screen. Once the item has finished moving, the function onMove is called, notifying the collection to reorder
									as done by the user. I then notify the Ranked List recycler view to change the display how the list was changed.
