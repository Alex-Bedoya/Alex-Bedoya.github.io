									<h1>Stock App</h1>
									<p>A group projoect that has a user pick a stock and trade with that stock for about 7 days and see the results after.</p>
								</header>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/StockHome.jpg" alt="" /></div>

								<p>
									The goal of this project was to give a user $10,000 to start with. The user would then pick a stock that they would want to trade with. The user would 
									then be placed on a random date, and asked if they want to buy, sell, or hold their current stocks. Once the user does one of those, the user would
									be placed on the next trade day and be prompted the same options. Once the 7 days are up the program would sell all the stocks the user owned
									and show a results page which shows the total loss or gain from those 7 days. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Some of the specifics of this project were that we were required to use Ajax methods to prevent redirects and page refreshes to update things on the page. 
									We were also required to have a data set of all the stocks and their daily prices. We had the options of using an API or just store it in a database, we decided on a database.
									We were additionally required to have 3 seperate ways to buy or sell the stocks, with one having an interactive graph. We used a text input, scroll bar, and a bar graph. 
								</p>

								<p>
									In this project I spent time working on the actual game logic and making sure there were checks for every buy, sell, and hold throughout the game. 
									That logic was luckily easy, but using Ajax seemed to give me more difficulty. Because of how Ajax works with Razor pages, the .cs class was not the
									same instance every time it was called through Ajax. So, I had to utulize the POST methods to store all the necessary data between each day that the user 
									played. I would pull the data from the POST, do the necessary logic, and send it back with the Ajax returning a json result. The problem is that I needed 
									to update many things on the page, not just one, so I made a new object, a data package, to send back as a json.
